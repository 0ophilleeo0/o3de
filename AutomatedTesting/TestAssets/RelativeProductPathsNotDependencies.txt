These tests are mostly done with files that have a different extension between source and product.
The source scan is done first, and will catch files in the source path.
Product path searching is resolved using "endsWith" logic.
textures/_dev_purple.dds
Back slashes, and project name in the path
automatedtesting\textures\_dev_stucco.dds
Double back slashes
textures\\_dev_tan.dds
Casing doesn't match
TEXTURES/_DEV_WHITE.dds
Some files have multiple extensions, this verifies that won't trip up the scanner.
textures/_dev_yellow_light.dds.2
Path inline textures/milestone2/ama_grey_02.dds test
Path after=textures/_dev_woodland.dds equal sign
